# Soyio docs proofread

## Goal
- Improve clarity and correctness for developers integrating Soyio.
- Keep content aligned with `STYLE_GUIDE.md`.
- Ensure integration guides with backend examples reference the corresponding API resource.

## Scope
- Primary scope: files under `docs/`.
- For integration backend flows, focus on `docs/integration-guide/`.
- Do not edit autogenerated API resource files in `docs/api/resources/`.

## Workflow

1) Identify changed docs
- Use `git diff` and limit review to docs files or a user-provided file list.

2) Read like an integrator
- Verify each step is understandable, actionable, and ordered correctly.
- Flag and fix missing prerequisites, unclear wording, or ambiguous instructions.

3) Proofread language quality
- Fix spelling, grammar, punctuation, and typographical issues.
- Improve sentence flow while preserving technical precision.

4) Validate style consistency
- Apply `STYLE_GUIDE.md` rules (tone, terminology, formatting, MDX usage).
- Keep terminology consistent across sections (API, SDK, backend, webhook, etc.).

5) Validate backend-to-API traceability
- For integration-guide content that mentions backend/server-side implementation or shows backend code examples, ensure there is at least one of:
  - An admonition that links to the corresponding API resource(s), or
  - A direct link to the corresponding API resource(s) in the API reference.

6) Apply fixes directly
- Edit the documentation files with concise, user-focused improvements.
- Keep links working and prefer existing project link conventions.

## Deliverable
- A concise list of updated files.
- A short summary of what was improved.
- Any remaining risks or follow-up suggestions (if applicable).
