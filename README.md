# Soyio Docs

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

```
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```
$ npm build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Linting and code style

The codebase uses `prettier` as code style enforcer. Please install it within your corresponding code editor.

We also use `eslint` as linter. Just run `npm run lint` to check if any offenses were commited.
